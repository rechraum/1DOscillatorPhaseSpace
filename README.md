Visualization of one dimensional oscillators intended to demonstrate the idea of phase space. Click 'Add Oscillator' to get started. 
The left hand side visualization plots the oscillators in a conventional XY plane while the right side shows their trajectory in 
phase space or configuration space. The phase space in this case is the displacement from the origin and the velocity of each oscillator.
The phase space can be thought of as a configuration space or state space representation of the spacetime dynamics.
